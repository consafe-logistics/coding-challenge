# Coding challenge

## Assignment 

A college student has worked on this project, but the outcome is of a questionable quality.

We would like to refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable. We would like to:

* apply clean code practices
* use Typescript for type checking
* use MobX for state handling
* use dependency injection
* use Jest for unit and integration testing
* apply MVVM pattern to separate rendering from the business logic

We **must not add any other tools to our stack**, but we have the ability to structure and refine code as we please, as long as the functionality remains the same.

## Prerequisites
