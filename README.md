# Coding challenge

## Background 

A college student has worked on this project, but the outcome is of a questionable quality.

We would like to refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable. We would like to:

* apply clean code practices
* use Typescript for type checking
* use MobX for state handling
* use dependency injection
* use Jest for unit and integration testing
* apply MVVM pattern to separate rendering from the business logic

We **must not add any other tools to our stack**, but we have the ability to structure and refine code as we please, as long as the functionality remains the same.

## Assignment

Please perform a **code review** of solution in this repository. 

List things you think can be improved and refactored along with reasoning about it and suggestions about how it can be done. You don't need to write the actual code (unless you want to and it will make things easier for you), however please document your findings in format of a Markdown file. You will be asked to present it during a technical interview and it will become a base for a further technical discussion.
